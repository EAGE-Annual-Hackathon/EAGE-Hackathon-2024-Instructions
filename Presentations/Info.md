There are two plenum sessions for this hackathon:
1. Introduction session covering the agenda, practicalities, github expectations, hackathon theme, resources, and technical information (tokens, logins..etc) - 1 hour including Q&A
2. Code Freeze - introduce expectations for the project presentations, upload to github and the judging criteria (these should be sent to judges ahead of time) - 15 minutes.
   - For sake of focusing on the hackathon and not on presentations, the code freeze presentation should not be put on github until just before the presentation.
