# EAGE-Hackathon-2024-Instructions
Here you will find all the info you need to know to participate in the [2024 EAGE Annual Hackathon in Oslo](https://eageannual.org/hackathon/)! 

This year, we seek for ways of solving geoscience problems in a computationally and energy-efficient way. Use AI to mimic the first-principle physics, or train a model to suggest hyperparameters for an algorithm and save multiple rounds of search iterations, or bring your code and make it work faster!

# Coding to Net-Zero - Using AI and Programming to Make an Impact on the Energy Transition!

# Participant Guide

This event will be facilitated in English and will be an in-person only event. To register, select the hackathon option during the registration for the annual event. Once registered do not hesitate to post in the following threads:

**üí° Brainstorm Ideas [here](https://github.com/orgs/EAGE-Annual-Hackathon/discussions/11)**<br>
**üõ†Ô∏è Explore resources [here](https://github.com/orgs/EAGE-Annual-Hackathon/discussions/13)**<br>
**üì£ Find your team [here](https://github.com/orgs/EAGE-Annual-Hackathon/discussions/12)**<br>
**üëâ Register [here](https://eageannual.org/registration/)**

## What you need to do as a hackathon participant:
1.  **Join the online meetup** in May to start thinking about ideas and forming a team if you don't already have one.
2.  **We will use a [Github discussion board](https://github.com/orgs/EAGE-Annual-Hackathon/discussions/12)** ‚Äì if you are looking for a team to join or have a topic that you would like some people to help you work on ‚Äì please post.
    - There will be some time on Sunday morning to finalize the teams, but the expectation is that you have tried to find a team upfront.
3. **Get your team ready!**
    - You will need to bring your laptop and power cable.
    - Ideate around the technical challenge your team will work on.  You can use our Github discussion board for this.  Remember the theme!
    - What data do you need?  The hackathon facilitators will put together some data for you to use.
    - Are you going to use an existing model or build one from scratch?
        - What technology will your team use (python packages, dashboards, interpreters..etc).  
The facilitators will provide some ideas and provide you with some technology to get you thinking - you can find [this thread](https://github.com/orgs/EAGE-Annual-Hackathon/discussions/11) in the discussion board above.
3. **Familiarize yourself with the agenda.**
    - This is a fairly short hackathon.  Your team will be expected to present your final outcome on Monday afternoon at 14:00.  That means code freeze will happen at 12:00.
    - With your team, try to come up with a plan of attack keeping in mind the short time.
4. **Yes, there will be a final presentation from each team** with two teams up for award from a judging panel of experts and from the hackathon participants.
    - The facilitators will reveal the criteria for the presentation Monday morning (this is so you can focus on your work and not on creating a presentation üòä)
    - Remember to take screenshots, record methods, and document your thought process along the way ‚Äì this will help you to faster put together a final presentation.
5. You are expected to upload all code to a repository in this hackathon Github organization.
6. **Award winners will be asked to present their results at the Energy Transition Theatre** within the main exhibition floor during the conference - schedule to be announced soon!.

**üçî Food:** Information to come!

**üìç Location:** The hackathon will be at the same conference venue as the rest of EAGE Annual: NOVA Spektrum - Messeveien 8, 2004 Lillestr√∏m, Norway.  It is a short walk from the train station at Lillestr√∏m - with connections to both airport and hotels and to the center of Oslo.  Stay tuned for the room.

## Pre-hackathon workshops
To equip our hackathon participants with crucial insights into LLMs and physics-based ML, we're excited to offer two comprehensive workshops. These sessions are designed not only to introduce the foundational technology behind our quickstart materials but also to serve as a prime networking opportunity, potentially helping you find your ideal teammate before the competition begins.

* **NeMo Framework for LLM Training and Fine-tuning:** A dive into the essentials of Language Model training and fine-tuning. This workshop aims to walk you through examples and methods needed to enable the adaptation of an LLM to a new knowledge domain. By [Oleg Ovcharenko](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ovcharenkoo/?originalSubdomain=ae)
<!-- **When:** June 5 [Wed, 1h]  -->

   * **NVIDIA Modulus for Reservoir Simulation and History Matching:** Explore the end-to-end reservoir simulation and history matching with physics-ML. Participants will understand the math behind the problem as well the details of its implementation. By [Clement Etienam](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/clement-etienam-ph-d-2aa66661)
<!-- **When:** June 6 [Thu, 1h]  -->

**Registered participants will receive an invitation email for workshops a few weeks before the EAGE Annual event.** It's a perfect chance to ask questions, clarify doubts, and connect with like-minded innovators.


## Quickstart materials (WIP)
Follow [this thread](https://github.com/orgs/EAGE-Annual-Hackathon/discussions/13) for datasets, packages, and tips and tricks:
We will have access to sufficient GPU resources.
