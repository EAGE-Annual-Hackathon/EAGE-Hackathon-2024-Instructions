# Participant Guide

This event will be facilitated in English and will be an in-person only event.

## What you need to do as a hackathon participant:
1.  Join the online meetup in May to start thinking about ideas and forming a team if you don't already have one.
2.  We will use a [Github discussion board](https://github.com/orgs/EAGE-Annual-Hackathon/discussions/12) â€“ if you are looking for a team to join or have a topic that you would like some people to help you work on â€“ please post.
    - There will be some time on Sunday morning to finalize the teams, but the expectation is that you have tried to find a team upfront.
3. Get your team ready!
    - You will need to bring your laptop and power cable.
    - Ideate around the technical challenge your team will work on.  You can use our Github discussion board for this.  Remember the theme!
    - What data do you need?  The hackathon facilitators will put together some data for you to use.
    - Are you going to use an existing model or build one from scratch?
        - What technology will your team use (python packages, dashboards, interpreters..etc).  
The facilitators will provide some ideas and provide you with some technology to get you thinking - you can find [this thread](https://github.com/orgs/EAGE-Annual-Hackathon/discussions/11) in the discussion board above.
3. Familiarize yourself with the agenda.
    - This is a fairly short hackathon.  Your team will be expected to present your final outcome on Monday afternoon at 14:00.  That means code freeze will happen at 12:00.
    - With your team, try to come up with a plan of attack keeping in mind the short time.
4. Yes, there will be a final presentation from each team with two teams up for award from a judging panel of experts and from the hackathon participants.
    - The facilitators will reveal the criteria for the presentation Monday morning (this is so you can focus on your work and not on creating a presentation ðŸ˜Š)
    - Remember to take screenshots, record methods, and document your thought process along the way â€“ this will help you to faster put together a final presentation.
5. Final presentation session will be recorded.
6. You are expected to upload all code to a repository in this Github organization.
7. Please note that the award winners will be asked to present their results at the Energy Transition Theatre within the main exhibition floor during the conference - schedule to be announced soon!.
